ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Lorenz Beck!

I am a geospatial data scientist and analyst. I believe that spatiotemporal data can fascinate people and play a crucial role in understanding today's complex interface between humanity and nature. I studied geography in my bachelors and geospatial technologies in my masters and have experience with environmental applications (natural hazards), the agrifood system (agriulture, traceability), and the sustainable mobility sector (cycling dashboard). My goal is to create a more sustainable future by putting people in the focus of digital and geospatial technologies.  

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, R, JavaScript and HTML for spatial data applications
