ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Lorenz Beck!

I am interested in geospatial technologies and spatial data science and analysis. I believe that spatiaotemporal data is fascinating people and can play a crucial role in many disciplines. I studied geography in my bachelors and geospatial technologies in my master and my goal is to fusion those disciplines to create a more sustainable future. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, R, JavaScript and HTML for spatial data applications
